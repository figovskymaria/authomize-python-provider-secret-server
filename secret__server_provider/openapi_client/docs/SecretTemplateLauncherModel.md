Secret Template Launcher Model

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**allow_list** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | User can select from values in this list | [optional] 
**connect_as_command** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | This command is used after a PuTTy session is launched on a Secret that has SSH Proxy enabled and has a Secret set under &#39;Connect As&#39; in the Launcher tab. The default su command is &#39;su - $USERNAME&#39;. $USERNAME is the token used to retrieve the username field from the Secret. Sudo can also be used by specifying &#39;sudo -u $USERNAME /bin/bash&#39;. | [optional] 
**connect_as_command_response** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | The Connect As Command Response is the response from the server prompting for a password. This is used so $productName knows when to send the password to the system. If the response from the server after typing &#39;su - root&#39; is &#39;Password:&#39; then the Connect As Command Response needs to contain &#39;Password:$PASSWORD&#39;. The $CONNECTASPASSWORD token will use the credentials from the Secret set under &#39;Connect As&#39; when prompted. | [optional] 
**deny_list** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | User cannot enter these values. If used with an Allow List, the Deny List will take precedence. | [optional]
