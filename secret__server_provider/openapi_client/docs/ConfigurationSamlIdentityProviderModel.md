**active** | **bool** | Active status of the Identity Provider. Users can only log-in via an active Identity Provider. | [optional] 
**authn_context** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | When specified, instructs the IDP on how to authenticate the user(optional). | [optional] 
**clock_skew** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | The allowed number of minutes of difference between Secret Server&#39;s clock and the IDP&#39;s clock.  The default is 3 minutes. | [optional]

**sign_logout_request** | **bool** | When true, logout requests sent to this IDP will be signed.&lt; | [optional] 
**sign_logout_response** | **bool** | When true, logout responses sent to this IDP will be signed. | [optional] 
**single_logout_service_response_url** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | The URL where Secret Server will send responses to single logout messages. | [optional] 
**single_logout_service_url** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | The URL to send the single logout message to. | [optional] 
**sso_service_binding** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | Method for communicating with the Identity Provider.  HTTPRedirect is recommended in most cases. | [optional]
